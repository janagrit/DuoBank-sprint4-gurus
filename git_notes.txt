Git Branching WorkFlow through Pull Requests:

1. Clone the framework into the local machine
2. Create a new branch -> git branch <branchName>
3. Switch to your branch -> git checkout <branchName>
   It is important to VERIFY ON WHICH BRANCH you are currently at before adding any changes -> git branch
4. Add your changes and commit your changes in your own branch.
5. Push the new branch to remote repository -> we need to give the name of the remote repository and the branch
     git push --set-upstream origin db_tests_sprint5 

6. Create a PR (Pull Request) in Github to merge my branch changes with the main. CLick on create a pull request button and indicate which branches must be merged. Other collaborators will be notified about this PR.

7. The person authorized to merge the PR will need to review and merge and close the PR. If there are merge conflicts, they must be resolved before merging.

8. Once the my branch changes are successfully merged with the main in GitHub, bring the changes from remote's main to local main with "git pull" while you are in main  branch locally
9. Once you have your and other team member's changes in your local main, to merge them into your branch use "git rebase main" or "git merge main" while in your branch
